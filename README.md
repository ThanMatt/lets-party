A chrome extension to watch Disney+ Hotsar with your friends and family built with NodeJS, Express, Socket.io and Heroku.

Me and my friends couldn't find a working chrome extension to stream Marvel's Loki in Hotstar. 
So I decided to make it myself and built this project in just under 8 hours. Well it was fun!

I have plans to extend this for Netflix and Amazon Prime. If you would like to contribute, the doors are all open :smile: refer the contribution guide.
