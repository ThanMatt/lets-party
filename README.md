A chrome extension to watch Disney+ Hotsar with your friends and family built with NodeJS, Express, Socket.io and Heroku.

Me and my friends couldn't find a working chrome extension to stream Marvel's Loki in Hotstar. 
So I decided to make it myself and made this fun little project in just under 8 hours. Well it was fun!

I have plans to extend this for Netflix and Amazon Prime. If you would like to contribute, the doors are all open :smile:

### üöÄ &nbsp; Development setup

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/thisissandip/what-should-i-watch-next.git
```

2. Upload the Client Folder in Chorme Extension.

3. Install server dependencies (You can skip this step 3 and 4, if you want to make changes just to the client and use the deployed server)

```
npm install
```
4. Start your local server 

```
npm start
```

Your local server will start PORT 4000

5. Start Playing!
